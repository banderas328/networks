## Developer

This module set provides tools that are useful for developers adding
features to Cypht. It adds 2 pages to the Settings menu:

- info: This page shows infromation about the Cypht installation,
  the status of existing server connections, and a configuration "map"
  that breaks down what modules are associated with what page, with
  links to the code online.

- dev: This page just has some summary information about developing
  module sets for Cypht, and has some links to online resources.

Cypht must be run in debug mode for these pages to be visible, in
production mode they are disabled.
