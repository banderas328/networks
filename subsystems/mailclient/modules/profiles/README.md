## Profiles

This module set adds a Profile page to the Settings menu that allows users to
configure profiles. A profile ties together an IMAP server, an SMTP server, and
values for the users E-mail address, reply to address, display name, and
signature. A profile is required for Cypht to be able to save an outbound
message into an IMAP server Sent folder. When composing a message users can
select which profile to use, and when replying the profile is automatically
selected.
