## Contacts

This module set does not do anything by itself. It provides the framework
for contact sources to be used in Cypht. Currently there are 3 contact
sources supported:

- local contacts: Basic contact support locally within Cypht
- LDAP contacts: Uses an LDAP server to access/manage contacts
- Gmail contacts: Read-only access to contacts from Gmail accounts

One or all of those module sets can be enabled with this one to add contact
support for that source. Some work has been done to add CardDav contact
support, however there is much left to do.
