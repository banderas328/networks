## Feeds

This module set adds RSS/ATOM feed reading support to Cypht. It adds a new
section to the menu for configured feeds, allows them to be integrated into the
combined views, and provides add/remove feed options to the Settings->Servers
page. Like E-mail content, feeds are filtered for security removing any remote
resources.
