## Recover settings

This module set provides users the ability to recover settings after a password
change. Cypht encrypts user settings with the user password as the basis for
the encryption key, so if that is changed externally, the user settings cannot
be decrypted. Using this module set, users can enter there old and new
passwords, and the settings can be converted.
